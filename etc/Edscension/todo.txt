done:  (of course, see the git repository for a full history; these are just notes)
- acquire Frat Warrior Fatigues, even if we don't have Wrath of Ra
- fixes to preparations for The Horror

done?
- rework of insults & blueprints
- handle automation of Such Great Heights if semi-rare counter leads us there
- cast Fist, rather than Storm, when it appears beneficial to do so.
- use renenutet and/or cat for filthworms, if we don't have Lash.
- buy spleens & haunches more aggressively, if there is a chance that we might
  not utilize them otherwise.
- ed_resumeCombat ought to work from the Underworld, or from either of the two
  choices arriving & departing there.
x more issues with stasis after using a renenutet.
x use friar buff @ goatlet
x Don't use cat for filthworms, if we have Lash
x don't bother with buying bandages until we might encounter The Horror or Zerg Rush.
x automate screwdriver quest for mys/mus signs
- (any other needed support for non-muscle signs:  frilly skirt)


TODO:
- eliminate extra outfit switching when considering A-Boo peak.
- fix gross overestimation of damage dealt by storm against hippies @ low mys.
- at start, not maintaining enough mp to finish off a hippy (need two fists)
- overall, starting with astral shorts is not working out....  yet.
- if we don't have the cat, should we defer nook until level 9?
- ran out of clovers on day 3, when I've only used one today for ores.  none
  left for A-Boo.  a-boo code currently does not make progress w/o clovers....
- should probably be using renenutets @ A-Boo.
- Various temporary conditions can trigger the "Please check your quests"
  abort.
- "Not quite boozed up" message when ready for billiards.
- got "Hit Ed defeat threshold" on second death @ Hippy Camp.
- Why do I sometimes get "Hit Ed defeat threshold" before I need to spend Ka?
  Where does that come from?  Mafia?  I don't see anything in the scripts....
- avoid adventuring twice for a semi-rare, if the first attempt didn't
auto-stop.  (this can happen if the user manually encounters the warning
before running the script, or has the bad luck to interrupt the script just
after it hits the warning.  I expect it happens if the user has not selected
the appropriate option in Mafia, as well?)
- we shouldn't get down to 1 adv on day 1 before buying the last haunch.
  which happened with chown.  not a big deal, but avoid if possible.
- release scribe first.  (need to do some analysis and/or experimentation to
  make sure this is better than priest.  or, at least, better in most cases.
  in fact, priest may be best if I have access to SMOOCH for xp.)
- turn off mafia's automtic mana burning, which sometimes extends Serqet.
- oh, but it looks like the script's mana burning isn't quite up to snuff.
- horus, shed, sgeea, cure-all, etc.  not sure what things need to be done, exactly....  but we need to avoid unnecessary use of cure-alls.
- support for SMOOCH
- Decision to do nuns might not be quite right.  I count a difference of about
25 turns on the battlefield.  Of course, an inhaler only lasts for 10, so some
actual calculations are needed to do it right.
- disable auto-recovery?  (uh, it already does that, i think.  In ed_ccAdv)
- handle opening of Hidden City, if we get Such Great Heights unexpectedly when looking for a semi-rare.  (should we still get the semi-rare, in order to have stone wool to finish the quest?  I think so.  It's easy enough to do, anyway.)
- don't try to open Hidden City if it is already open.  (fixed by Zen00?)
x support clover use for levelling?
- odd aborts at You the Adventurer
- after starting battle with You, aborted with "We can't find the jerk
adventurer" upon first death.  dunno what was up with that.
- aborts from deaths at wisniewski
- spent a Ka at You the Adventurer
- spent a Ka at Hidden Apartment Building
- beaten up by a Zerg Rush  (uh, yeah, that happens.  just make sure the
script buys some linen bandages, and doesn't abort.  does it still abort?)
- use renenutet (and/or cat) in Harem?  (check other uses of lash, too.
  probably anywhere we use lash is a good candidate for a renenutet as well.
  I noticed that Lash was used against a G Imp, but no Renenutet when it failed
  to elicit a hot wing.)
- use cat at f'c'le.  oh?  maybe we need Ka, though.  Well, still, I think cat
would be better.
- oh, "cheese thief in the cheese night" gives goat cheese.  for low
  skillcount, that's probably how we get it.
- double-check that we still work okay with astral mask
x avoid getting Winklered if we aren't doing nuns.
- avoid extending the Prayer of Seshat +ml buff, when it's time to fight
ninja.  Let it run out.
- Are we currently buying Renenutets when budget easily allows it?  Some
additional tweaks might be nice.
- fix attempts to equip the same item in all three accessory slots.
- "Invalid setting 5 for choiceAdventure670"
- "That area is not available" while trying to get to The mist-shrouded peak!
(fixed already?)
- more priority to Even More Elemental Wards. don't buy Armor Plating before
it.  Fixed, I think.
- "You are currently in a choice" from pre-adventure for The Horror
- "You are currently in a fight" at spooky forest.
- "You are currently in a fight" at hulking bridge troll.
- why the 10-turn limit at the hidden park?
- eliminate the "Invalid setting X for choiceAdventureYYY" messages
- support for eating & drinking.  support for switching the semi-rare
  consumables collected.
- improved support for other astral items (bracer works best right now?)
- other Mr. Store content that chown has?  VIP stuff, CSA
- if we are looking for the amulet at the airship, use the cat.
- why was mcd set to 0 for Oil Peak?  Don't I want +ml?
- I once got "You ran out of restores" after a Zerg Rush.  No abort,
  just a red message.  But, I hadn't run out.
- hot plate occasionally interferes with attempts to go shopping (or heal) in
  the underworld.
- Improved behavior when low on meat & expensive buffs (Bounty) are available.
- Also, use meat to maintain buffs when rich in meat, but Ka is tight.
- what's the deal with the red warning message about "boring binder clip
  doesn't make anything interesting"?  I'm going to remove it.
- oh, and remove the "testX" messages that appear when the dying/UNDYING status is
  modified.
- if I am particularly rich in Ka (say, day 4, or whatever) I can actually affort to spend
  more of them on flyering....
- If Wisniewski is likely to cost Ka, check to see if we have some on hand,
  and automatically pay the first few.  (I've had to pay 15 total on an
  unskilled character.)
- if we acquire equipment (bum cheek, etc.) at the sleazy back alley, we may
  want to use it.
- avoid buying bandages until we might need them.
- avoid buying talisman of Horus until we might need it.  Avoid keeping a
  second one around untill we might need it as well.
- if we abort, (okay, when we abort) should we try to set the charpane back to compact mode?
- why compact mode in the first place?
- why do we wait until after the war to finish Boo Peak?
- use lash, renenutets to get a-boo clues.  maybe use wrath, too?
- may want to use Shed at black forest.  possibly.
- need to fix equipment when doing hidden city:  why do I have talisman o'
  namislat and antique machete?
- use old rosewater cream?
- use of curse of indecision seems excessive.  not sure yet, but I may need to
  tweak it.  Yes.  Definitely.  I'm sure.
- possibly use lianas, bowling balls, The Horror, and other easy-to-trigger
  adventures to burn off unwanted buffs, rather than using SGEEA-like items.
- add a proper ed_resume function that does ed_resumeCombat(); ed_ascend()
- add a reporting function that displays the status of all the quests, plus
  any useful info like # of Ka, adventures, organ count, skill count.
- "We should have a Talisman 'O Namislat but we don't know anything about it"
  (Talisman got made immediately after the message.)
- Deal more gracefully with low meat situations at the beginning of the run.
- tavern appears to have its own loop.  does it, uh, handle semi-rares?  are
  there other things it might be missing?
- script had hippy stench while doing alcove, which may prolong it a bit.
- horus should be good for f'c'le
- get rid of red text "Monster defeated in initialization".
- 20 rounds of attacking with weapon vs chalk dust wraiths
- when we don't have skills for getting items to drop, we probably don't want to fight the snake knight.
- don't bother getting the inhaler if we are certain we won't do the nuns.
- ed_resumeCombat isn't working.  ??
- eliminate attempts to uneffect Shelter of Shed for F'c'le if no SGEEA items.

from forum thread:
- better recovery if user squandered her meat at the start of the run, without
  opening the island.
- handle if a battle action is set ?
- 
-Gets stuck on Lair of Ninja Snowmen due to no +combat
 (fixed?)
-Tries to semi-rare in the same place twice
-Amulet loop in the castle quest
-Several issues with getting stuck when not having certain skills due to low skill points
-Fights chateau paintings twice instead of using as a copy (no need for two bram's)
-Often doesn't handle full or drunkness (possibly not an intended feature)
-Sometimes has very unoptimal equips (probably a maximizer issue)
-Doesn't flier every fight (this could be a non-issue/is not necessary)
-Stuck on palindome (no disposible instant camera)
-Gets stuck if not enough meat for dinghy (could move on until enough meat?)

-Does not use spookyraven makeup items for +exp (I'm sure there are other items like this but I was just going off of Ezandora's Guide when I noted this)
-Does not use VIP items: shower, pool table, hatter - pool table and hatter buffs could be pretty useful
-Does not use gameinform for dungeoneering kit
-Does not use clovers (? I'm actually not sure if I'm right about this, never bothered to check the actual script)
-Does not use camp scout backpack items (firestarting kit +hp/mp can be useful)
-Does not look high with the telescope (minor minor)
-Does not get or use chateau desk potions (a bit unnecessary)
-Does not change chateau skylight/fan at the end of the day for +adv (could be enabled if enough meat available)
-The deck of every card can be very useful now!
-BHH acquisition (this is of course not necessarily trivial)

- my own opinion on, e.g., lucrecore, is that the script should work
  acceptably-well if a user does a bunch of other automated or manual
  adventuring before and/or after running ed_ascend.  The only additional
  support needed, i.m.o., is a way to reserve turns at the end of the day.

- automated eating & drinking, of course.

- revisit that ninja snowman assassin stuff....  are appropriate checks
  done up front?

- does spookyraven 2nd floor unlock properly?  there's a mafia setting??
- possibly buy & equip a third-hand lantern before doing hippies, since we
  might lose initiative a lot.
