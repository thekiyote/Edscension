done:  (of course, see the git repository for a full history; these are just notes)
- acquire Frat Warrior Fatigues, even if we don't have Wrath of Ra
- fixes to preparations for The Horror

done?
- rework of insults & blueprints
- handle automation of Such Great Heights if semi-rare counter leads us there
- cast Fist, rather than Storm, when it appears beneficial to do so.
- use renenutet and/or cat for filthworms, if we don't have Lash.
- buy spleens & haunches more aggressively, if there is a chance that we might
  not utilize them otherwise.


TODO:
- use friar buff @ goatlet
- horus, shed, sgeea, cure-all, etc.  not sure what things need to be done, exactly....  but we need to avoid unnecessary use of cure-alls.
- support for SMOOCH
- Decision to do nuns might not be quite right.  I count a difference of about
25 turns on the battlefield.  Of course, an inhaler only lasts for 10, so some
actual calculations are needed to do it right.
- Don't use cat for filthworms, if we have Lash
- disable auto-recovery?  (uh, it already does that, i think.  In ed_ccAdv)
- don't bother with buying bandages until we might encounter The Horror or Zerg Rush.
- handle opening of Hidden City, if we get Such Great Heights unexpectedly when looking for a semi-rare.  (should we still get the semi-rare, in order to have stone wool to finish the quest?  I think so.  It's easy enough to do, anyway.)
- don't try to open Hidden City if it is already open
- support clover use for levelling?
- odd aborts at You the Adventurer
- after starting battle with You, aborted with "We can't find the jerk
adventurer" upon first death.  dunno what was up with that.
- aborts from deaths at wisniewski
- spent a Ka at You the Adventurer
- spent a Ka at Hidden Apartment Building
- beaten up by a Zerg Rush  (uh, yeah, that happens.  just make sure the
script buys some linen bandages, and doesn't abort.  does it still abort?)
- automate screwdriver quest for mys/mus signs
- (any other needed support for non-muscle signs)
- use renenutet (and/or cat) in Harem?  (check other uses of lash, too.
  probably anywhere we use lash is a good candidate for a renenutet as well.
  I noticed that Lash was used against a G Imp, but no Renenutet when it failed
  to elicit a hot wing.)
- use cat at f'c'le.  oh?  maybe we need Ka, though.  Well, still, I think cat
would be better.
- got "Hit Ed defeat threshold" on second death @ Hippy Camp.
- Why do I sometimes get "Hit Ed defeat threshold" before I need to spend Ka?
  Where does that come from?  Mafia?  I don't see anything in the scripts....
- double-check that we still work okay with astral mask
- avoid getting Winklered if we aren't doing nuns.
- avoid extending the Prayer of Seshat +ml buff, when it's time to fight
ninja.  Let it run out.
- avoid adventuring twice for a semi-rare, if the first attempt didn't
auto-stop.  (this can happen if the user manually encounters the warning
before running the script, or has the bad luck to interrupt the script just
after it hits the warning.)
- Are we currently buying Renenutets when budget easily allows it?  Some
additional tweaks might be nice.
- fix attempts to equip the same item in all three accessory slots.
- "Invalid setting 5 for choiceAdventure670"
- "That area is not available" while trying to get to The mist-shrouded peak!
(fixed already?)
- more priority to Even More Elemental Wards. don't buy Armor Plating before
it.  Fixed, I think.
- "You are currently in a choice" from pre-adventure for The Horror
- "You are currently in a fight" at spooky forest.
- why the 10-turn limit at the hidden park?
- eliminate the "Invalid setting X for choiceAdventureYYY" messages
- support for eating & drinking.  support for switching the semi-rare
  consumables collected.
- improved support for other astral items (bracer works best right now?)
- other Mr. Store content that chown has?  VIP stuff, CSA
- if we are looking for the amulet at the airship, use the cat.
- why was mcd set to 0 for Oil Peak?  Don't I want +ml?
- I once got "You ran out of restores" after a Zerg Rush.  No abort,
  just a red message.  But, I hadn't run out.
- hot plate occasionally interferes with attempts to go shopping (or heal) in
  the underworld.
- Improved behavior when low on meat & expensive buffs (Bounty) are available.
